# A--Search-for-Directed-Graphs
An A* Search script for Directed and Weighted Graphs.
Note: There must be only one edge between the adjacent nodes, as the code is built in a way that
each node has only one edge for their adjacents.
The script uses two separate files, "nodes.csv" and "edges.csv" then creates a new file named
"path.csv" which contains the calculated path.
The three files are uploaded to serve as en example.
